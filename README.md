## Chapter 1; Regarding SDLC Testing

**§ V & V**
Verification -> involve meetings and reviews to evaluate the documents, plans, requirements and specifications.
Validation -> involve the actual testing.

**§ Waterfall Model**
(= Sequential Model) 
-> Each stage follows on from the previous step

**§ V ± Model**

**§ Spiral**
-> involve relationships between development and testing are clearly defined
**§ RAD**
-> Rapid Application Development, software development process (1980s)
-> developed to overcome the rigidity of such processes as µThe Waterfall Model¶.
>>> 6 elements of RAD
**Prototyping**
Creating a reduced-feature application, loosely resembling the finished product within a short period of time
**Iterative Development**
Creation of numerous versions of the applications
**Time-boxing**
A process of bumping features to future versions to prevent the iteration from running out of time
**Team Members**
Small teams consisting of adaptable, multi-skilled and highly motivated workers needed to perform a RAD development
**Management Approach**
Highly motivated workers depend on a good manager
**RAD Tools**
The latest technologies should be used for RAD sparing no expense
