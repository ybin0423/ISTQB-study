### Chapter 1; Regarding SDLC Testing

**§ V & V**
Verification -> involve meetings and reviews to evaluate the documents, plans, requirements and specifications.
Validation -> involve the actual testing.

**§ Waterfall Model**
(= Sequential Model) 
-> Each stage follows on from the previous step

**§ V ± Model**

**§ Spiral**
-> involve relationships between development and testing are clearly defined
**§ RAD**
-> Rapid Application Development, software development process (1980s)
-> developed to overcome the rigidity of such processes as µThe Waterfall Model

### 6 elements of RAD

>**Prototyping**
Creating a reduced-feature application, loosely resembling the finished product within a short period of time
>
>**Iterative Development**
Creation of numerous versions of the applications
>
>**Time-boxing**
prevent the iteration from running out of time
>
>**Team Members**
Small teams consisting of adaptable, multi-skilled and highly motivated workers needed to perform a RAD development
>
>**Management Approach**
manager must prevent any obstacles, and be heavily involved with the development to ensure iterative cycles stay on track
>
>**RAD Tools**
 speed of the development process and not on the cost of tools (CASE tools used)

**DSDM**
DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Methodology) is basically a high level framework of already
proven RAD techniques, and also management controls used to increase the chances of
successful RAD projects
장점; easily modified for an individual projects specific needs 
단점; lack of detail

**Process Interface**
interaction with the test process

### Testing Methods

**Component Testing**
known as Unit, Module, or Program Testing. In simple terms, this type of
testing focuses simply on testing of the individual components

**Component Integration Testing**
 concerned with ensuring the interactions between the software
components at the module level behave

**Functional System Testing**
 focuses on what the system is actually supposed to do.(= functional requirement)

Functional Requirement; requirement that specifies a function that a system component must perform

**Requirements-based Functional Testing**
simply testing the functionality of the software/system
based on the requirements

**Business Process Functional Testing:**
Different ways of using developed software are analysed and business scenarios are then created.

### Non-Functional System Testing

**Load Testing**
Testing the ability of the system to be able to bear loads

**Performance Testing**
A program/system may have requirements to meet certain levels of performance

**Stress Testing**
Stress Testing simply means putting the system under stress (sort of duration testing)
